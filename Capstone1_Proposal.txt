Cooking/Recipe App


STEP 1


* Create a website that allows users to search for specific recipes which includes ingredient lists, and cooking steps. Cooking time, nutritional value

* Ability to search recipes by no filter or by dietary restrictions or by ingredients.

* included wine pairing suggestions

* Offer seasonal dish suggestions to users based on the time of year and/or holiday. Requests a random(popular) food that has the tag of the season in it(season would be a variable based off of the date) 




Step 2 User Profile

* Create a user profile. User passwords would be encrypted with bcrypt
* ability to save favorite recipes for easy access.
* Ability to send an email of ingredient list for shopping using the sendgrid email API
* ability to publicly comment on a recipe/leave a review

Database Schema 
Would need to use a many to many relationship to link users to favorites recipes, and also a many to many to link users to comments and recipes
